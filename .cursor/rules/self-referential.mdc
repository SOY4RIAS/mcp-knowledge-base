# Self-Referential Knowledge Base

## Overview
The MCP Knowledge Base Server will use itself to store and retrieve development-related information, creating a self-documenting and self-improving system.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Auto-Indexing Service
- Automatically index all project documentation, code comments, and development notes
- Monitor file changes and Git commits for real-time updates
- Extract development context from code changes and documentation
- Maintain development history and decision records

### Development Context Extraction
```typescript
interface DevelopmentContext {
  git_commit: string;
  branch: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  environment: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production';
  version: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  affected_files: string[];
  performance_impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  security_impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

### Use Cases
- **Onboarding**: New developers can query the knowledge base about project structure
- **Troubleshooting**: Search for similar issues and their solutions
- **Architecture Reviews**: Understand design decisions and their context
- **Performance Optimization**: Find historical performance data
- **Feature Development**: Access related features and implementation patterns

### Best Practices
- Ensure self-indexing doesn't create infinite loops
- Implement proper filtering to avoid indexing sensitive information
- Use appropriate tags and metadata for development documents
- Maintain clear separation between user content and development content
- Implement rate limiting for self-indexing operations

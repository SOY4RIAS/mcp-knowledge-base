# Performance Optimization

## Caching Strategy
- Use Redis for caching search results, embeddings, and metadata
- Implement appropriate TTL values (search results: 5min, embeddings: 1hour)
- Use cache warming for frequently accessed data
- Monitor cache hit rates and optimize accordingly

## Database Optimization
- Use batch operations for bulk data processing
- Implement connection pooling
- Monitor query performance and optimize indexes
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Implement query result caching

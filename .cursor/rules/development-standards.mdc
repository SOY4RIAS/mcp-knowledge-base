# Development Standards

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- Implement comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
- Follow consistent code formatting (use Prettier)

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all core services (aim for 90%+ coverage)
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Add performance tests for vector operations
- Include security tests for authentication and authorization
- Use mocking strategies for external dependencies (Weaviate, AI SDK)

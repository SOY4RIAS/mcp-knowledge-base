# Project Context

You are working on a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that serves as a knowledge base using vector database technology. This server enables AI assistants to access, search, and retrieve information through semantic search capabilities.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Phase 1**: Bun (JavaScript/TypeScript) runtime with Hono framework
- **Phase 2**: Go migration (future)
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate (recommended choice)
- **Embedding Service**: AI SDK with OpenAI-like API support
- **Framework**: Hono (Bun), Gin/Echo (Go)
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker

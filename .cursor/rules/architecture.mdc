# Architecture Principles

## System Design
- Follow modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Implement layered architecture: API Layer → Service Layer → Data Layer
- Design for scalability from day one (support 1M+ documents, 1B+ vectors)
- Ensure high performance (< 100ms search latency, 95th percentile)
- Build with security-first approach (JWT auth, encryption, rate limiting)

## Code Organization
- Use TypeScript for type safety in Phase 1
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout
- Follow dependency injection patterns for testability
- Use environment-based configuration management
- Maintain clear API contracts and documentation

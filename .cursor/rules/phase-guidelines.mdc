# Phase-Specific Guidelines

## Phase 1 (Bun + Hono)
- Leverage Bun's performance optimizations
- Use Hono's lightweight and fast framework
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper async/await patterns
- Use Bun's built-in testing framework
- Optimize for Bun's JavaScript runtime

## Phase 2 (Go Migration)
- Follow Go best practices and conventions
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Implement proper error handling with error wrapping
- Use Go's concurrency patterns (goroutines, channels)
- Optimize for Go's performance characteristics
